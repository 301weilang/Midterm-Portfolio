			<h1>1). Introduction essay</h1>
			<p>As a rhetor I have indicated great strengths that were made possible through studying a course in WRITING 39B SEM F: CRIT READING & RHET (33055). I have improved in rhetoric analysis by building on arguments by linking primary and secondary sources. The rhetoric analysis I did for the course was on a book by Ted Chiang known as ‘understand’. The primary sources that I used for the rhetorical analysis will be shown later in this document. But first let us take time and know the process of conducting an effective rhetorical analysis.</p>
			<p>You need to first have a topic sentence that determines the way that each point of your essay will be written. After developing more than one topic sentences then you need to state the evidence from the primary source and from the secondary source. This will make the paragraph have a transition that builds up to the thesis statement. After writing more than one topic sentence then the next item is to decode a thesis statement from the written topic sentences. By this stage the argument of the essay is already shaping up so what you need to do is to join all this parts in one essay. The essay should be established on the written topic sentences with each topic sentence carrying its own paragraph. </p>
			<p>All this lessons have been enabled through constant determination and sheer hard work. Writing a strong thesis statement was not easy for me but I reviewed a PowerPoint on building strong thesis statement. This is what made my writing become so easy and right now I can develop very good essays that are thesis developed. I would also urge you to trust the process of hard work and commitment and finally it produces good results. Writing a good thesis statement is not all about writing sentences or arranging ideas in chronological order. It is a logical sequence of ideas that make a reader develop a feel of what a writer is talking about.</p>
			<p>Here are some things that I learnt as far as writing a good thesis statement is concerned: Very specific. It’s not enough that you say imagery is being used. You’ll want to say what kind of imagery is being used. Has a logical flow and not a list. Explains the how of its being done and also the why. Typically has multiple sentences and will be half or more of your intro.</p>
			<p>Although you might find it a huge struggle to combine all these aspects of a good thesis statement in one, a good thesis statement is worth the effort. You could face a challenge close to mine of rushing to write a thesis statement. Please do not be tempted to rushing to write a good thesis statement. Taking time before concluding on the best statement to use for a thesis challenges many people including myself. However the effort is always very well rewarding and makes it easier for the reader to follow through the essay with ease.</p>
			<h1> 2). A copy of my final RA draft with work cited</h1>
			<h1>A Rhetoric Analysis of a short story-understand by Ted Chiang</h1>
			<p>Ted Chiang shows a mastery of rhetorical styles as he narrates the story understand. Some of the rhetorical styles that Ted applies in understand include: use of simple descriptive language, use of first person narration, repetition, use of possibilities of a limitless human brain, and use of a protagonist and an antagonist conflict. In a normal science fiction story you would expect that the author uses very strong technical terms to establish the plot of the story. Ted Chiang who cleverly infuses both simple language and scientific terms to writing the novel understand. Still, the story is very captivating because of repeated rhetorical styles that elicit symbolism in the mind of a reader. By reading the words of the story you tend to picture the fantasy world that Ted Chiang is writing on.</p>
			<p>Chiang uses simple descriptive language that the reader understands to talk about a complex biological concept. This kind of style is appealing to Ted’s audience in many ways. First the reader easily understands what the reader is communicating in his words. Secondly the reader is able to see the fantasy world that Ted is creating by envisioning it in his mind. Thirdly the reader feels as a part of the story because this words are familiar to readers of all educational backgrounds. For example in this part of the story Chiang uses scientific concepts but they are still easy to understand for a person without a background knowledge on sciences. “The latest reports confirm my prediction: those with greater brain damage display greater increases in intelligence. PET scans reveal heightened brain metabolism” (Chiang 46). Blake also notes that this is a story seeped in science fiction, yet the reader does not feel alienated at any point since the author has refrained from using overtly technical terms” (Blake).</p>
			<p>The second rhetorical style that Ted applies in the story understand is use of first person narration. Ted uses first person perspective in the narration in most of the story that makes the author develop an emotional appeal with the reader and makes the story engaging. The story is told from the narrator’s point of view. As the story opens, one can easily tell that the person narrating the story is the one who is going through a dangerous ordeal. “A layer of ice; it feels rough against my face, but not cold. I’ve got nothing to hold on to; my gloves just keep sliding off it. I can see people on top, running around, but they can’t do anything” (Liang 37). This aspect of narrating the story from the first person narration is what makes it believable. The reader also is able to tell some aspects of his life in a way that nobody else can. The first person narration also allows the reader to see how the narrator is interacting with characters and the settings of the scene. According to Blake, when a personal tale is told by somebody else, it loses some sense of belonging (Blake). At the end of the day there are some minor details about personal life that are missed. For example we are able to tell the nightmares that are affecting the narrator because of his emotions as he narrates how shaken they make him feel as he attends an appointment with his doctor. So in the end telling a story about a person’s life from his own view means that every detail will be told. It is this small details that make the story very captivating</p>
			<p>The third rhetorical style that Ted Chiang uses in the novel ‘Understand’ is application of possibilities of a limitless human brain. The story tells a tale of how human brains have their brains limited by nature. Clausen who is a visiting doctor is hired by the CIA to investigate the potential of hormone K for producing strategists (Chiang 48) is discovered by Leon to be acting in a friendlier manner than other daughters that examine him. He senses immediately that the CIA will retain him for more tests. Once they realize that hormone K can be a good way of making strategists they will starve other soldiers with oxygen and induce the hormone in them. At this part of the story Chiang shows how CIA want to use Leon as a CIA resource. Leon on the other hand does not want to be used as a CIA resource so he leaves Boston. According to (Blake 19), the audience appreciates this conflict because they support the decision of Leon to escape. According to Blake, it is morally wrong for the CIA to use their power to control the mind of a human. The reader is also fascinated by the computer science powers that Leon has, he can hack into the FDA database and load a virus that makes it hard for them to track the license plate of his vehicle. “Therefore, I’ve taken the liberty of inserting a virus in the DMV computer that will substitute information whenever my license plate number is requested (Chiang 51). The possibilities of what a super brain can do is limitless. Chiang uses this rhetoric device to make the audience support the main character’s quest to escape. Many other writers also use this style when trying to win over the empathy of the public in novels of stealing. For example, by making the police look bad the thieves gain the public’s support.</p>
			<p>The fourth rhetorical style that Chiang applies throughout his novel is use of repetition. There are some phrases and incidences that are repeated in the whole story. For example Ted Chiang repeats the words: (The FDA, CIA, Pennsylvania, database, computer security, virus, and super computer) among others. This words appear in the second part of the novel and recurs for more than one time in the context that they are used. This draws the attention of the reader to certain words, emphasizes certain ideas. These words are catchy and make the novel easy to recall by the reader (Hebblethwaite). Most of the repeated passages are important to the plot of the story. Chiang’s use of repetition keeps the reader glued to the last full stop. Repetition is a figure of speech that adds glamour to the story. Chiang infuses this figure of speech with other scientific/technical terms to come up with a nice plot of a story. In some other instances writers use repetition for establishing a rhythm. Ted Chiang also uses repetition to achieve rhythm too which makes the story even more memorable. The style of repetition is carefully applied by Chiang in this novel, to achieve rhythm, emphasis, draw attention, and make catchy terms. This makes the important parts of the story stand out and remain memorable for the reader.</p>
			<p>The fifth and final rhetoric style we cover in this essay that is used by Ted Chiang is use of a protagonist & antagonist conflict. Tension builds as Leon prepares to meet the mysterious Reynolds an individual who has undergone through a similar intelligent enhancing treatment (Chiang 69). Ted uses these two characters to show some similarities in their interests to invoke a response from the reader on whose approach is better given their super powers. Chiang shows how these two characters have played against each other such as killing each other. However the two characters have decided not pursue the strategies to kill each other. Ted wants to the two characters to reach to a resolution for the sake of a moral teaching for his audience. However, the conflict between the antagonist and the protagonist is difficult to reach to a good resolution. As for the protagonist he wants to develop a language for himself where he can live a life of his own far away from the normal people. The antagonist on the other hand wants to use his skills to save the world from corruption and other evils in the world.  According to (Hebblethwaite 6) an important moral question whether an increase in human intelligence threatens their morality arises. “If it were possible to ‘grow out’ of normal human intelligence, would one also grow out of human morality?” (Hebblethwaite 6) No matter the kind of response that the two characters indicate, one thing is clear and that is they are not settling to a resolution. So they decide to settle the things through a battle till one person’s brain activity seizes. The conflict ends with Leon arising victorious over the antagonist Reynold. This shows that morality is all in the eyes of the person looking from a different perspective. Through the conflict Ted indicates that heightened intelligence does not grow out human morality.</p>
			<p>In conclusion Chiang applies an array of rhetorical techniques to make his narrative captivating. These rhetorical techniques include: use of simple descriptive language, use of first person narration in the story, showing the possibilities of a limitless human brain, repetition and use of a protagonist and antagonist conflict. These array of rhetorical techniques are carefully woven with scientific technical terms achieving the sci-fi nature that Ted uses as his writing style. The general feel of the novel is science fiction one because of the choice of words and second because of the plot of the story. A person who however lacks the understanding of scientific terms cannot be alienated from reading the book anyway. This is because the author still chooses to infuse some simple English words and figures of speech. This brings out the feel of a normal telenovela story that most of the readers are accustomed to.</p>

			<p>Blake, John. "Understand By Ted Chiang". Fuzzy rants, 2019, https://afuzzyrants.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/understand-by-ted-chiang/.</p>
			<p>John Blake is a professional writer with journals and academic articles with an experience in writing. John Blake argues that Ted Chiang in the story Ted Chiang shows more of his writing abilities when he uses many rhetoric devices to make his story interesting. His argument is that ‘understand’ is an engaging story that reflects on the limits that nature imposes on most of the human abilities. To achieve this engaging story Ted Chiang uses hard science and simple story telling. He also uses symbolism by arranging words in a way that they can be pictured by the humans’ eyes. I chose this author because his article is up to date and reflects on the contemporary writing styles.</p>
			<p>Rothman, Joshua. "Ted Chiang’s Soulful Science Fiction". The New Yorker, 2019, https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/ted-chiangs-soulful-science-fiction.</p>
			<p>Rothman is an editor with the New Yorker magazine and he specifically writes as a book reviewer. Rothman argues that Ted Chiang is a good writer who is the greatest of our time because his choice of science-fiction is unique. In Understand, the protagonist knits together the vocabularies of science and art, memory and prediction, literature and math, physics and emotion. This aspects of his story make it very interesting. I selected this article because it contributed to some credible source for my bibliography because of the reputability of the publishing company (The New Yorker).</p>
			<p>  Chiang, Ted. Stories of Your Life and Others. Tor Books, 2002, pp. 37-79.</p>
			<p>Ted Chiang is a science fiction author known for his great science fiction that was adapted to film known as ‘Arrival’. His choice of science fiction makes him stand out as a unique writer because this is a subject that most regard as technical and difficult to write on. Understand is a story of a man who has his mental capability increased when he is given a diagnosis of hormone K to heal his brain from an accident. The drug improves all his cognitive functions and improves his intelligence in a significant manner. Reynold later on meets Reynold another human with the same capabilities. The two individuals stand in adversity since they have different spectrums in regards to motivation and what they hope to achieve with the immense brain power.</p>
			<h1>4). Artifacts (a.k.a. Process Work)</h1>
			<p>Claims analysis, Extended Outline.</p>
			<p>In this exercise the requirement was to breakdown parts of the essay into simple and understandable paragraphs with a logical flow. Successful construction of each and every paragraph would contribute to writing a great thesis statement.</p>
			<p>RA (Full draft)</p>
			<p>This exercise was all about combining the topic sentences, analysis and evidence in one logical flowing paragraph and overall into one big essay. Writing with good transitions was the key to making a consistent logical essay that was thesis driven.</p>
			<p>RA Peer and Self-Review.</p>
			<p>This exercise would allow writers in the class as well as myself to review what other students had written and come up with a review. The advantages of this exercise was it allowed readers to see the perspective of other writers. The disadvantage was that it made it easy to copy the way that other writers constructed their essays</p>
